with input you can do this:
loops = input("loops")
this means that the input next too loops is loops.
Now lets contunue with while loops.
first you will say that the input next to answer is loop. 
then you write a while loop saying:
while answer is the same as (two times a equals sighn) while then a double dot ':'
then hit enter and then for your last answer do print('i know how to do while loops')
